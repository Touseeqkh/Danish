# CNN-and-MLP
This project implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for analyzing and processing graph-related data. It explores how deep learning techniques can be applied to structured data, particularly in graph-based learning tasks.
Features
CNN for Feature Extraction – Utilizes convolutional layers to process structured graph data.
MLP for Classification – Implements a multi-layer perceptron for node classification and prediction.
Python Implementation – Includes well-documented Python scripts for both models.
Technologies Used
Python – A Core programming language.
PyTorch / TensorFlow – Deep learning frameworks.
NumPy & Pandas – For data manipulation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn – For visualization.
